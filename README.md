# OSCP Note taking template

This is my note taking template i used during my OSCP experience. You can git clone it and edit it the way you want. I have created a sample report writeup using markdown so you can use it. It is best to use the markdown cheatsheet by Adam-p [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
